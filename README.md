A mini-project which implements and test the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression in different scenarios. (Includes Lipschitzness and Boundedness analysis.) 

Logistic loss function was used.
Training & testing data: Gaussian distribusion with 1/2 probability x=(1/4,1/4,1/4,1/4), y=1, and other 1/2 probability x=(-1/4,-1/4,-1/4,-1/4), y=-1.
Variance were 0.2, 0.4.
Testing sample size 400.
Training sample size 50, 100, 500, 1000.
Results 99% correctness.
